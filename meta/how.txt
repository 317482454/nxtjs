How is this going to be done

- loader/verifier/full source *can't load full as that would centralize
  - verify source first..
  - verifer must be in this step as the verifier must be verified.
    - takes ajax of referal, sha256, sign with magic numbers, iframed in..
    - needs to read alias with info or properties?
  - function Jay.nxtGetRequest
    - get alias headers as well as loaders * watch out for alias data = atomic
  - properties, exempt from verify
  - Jay.nxtrequest, supernet request.
  - log in situation?
  - AMs for storing versions of plugins.
  - sigs on plugins will have shas of alias, remove atomic.
